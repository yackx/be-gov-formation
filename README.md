**Program to form a governement after the 2019 Belgian federal elections ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª**

For the impatient: [a sample of possible governments](sample.txt).

Forming a governement after the recent Belgian elections is more challenging than ever. It is said that it might be impossible. Belgium holds the [world record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_Belgian_government_formation) as a country without an elected gouvernment since the 2010-11 crisis.

This program checks all possible combinations to form a government given constraints like
the number of seats, the parties known restrictions to form a government with certain other parties,
and the will to keep a balance in the FR/NL repartition.

## Applicability

This program has been designed for Belgium. However, if it works in Belgium, it is bound to succeed anywhere else on the planet.

It can be used by curious citizens, politicians, person in charge of the government formation (*formateur*, *informateur*, *dÃ©mineur* or any other role we will make up this time), or monarchs in charge of designating such person.

## Known limitations

* The exclusion list is incomplete
* A valid government composition does not guarantee its success.
